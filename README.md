## My process

### Built with

- HTML / CSS
- SCSS
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I feel like I could've achieved a result that didn't use media queries if I was more comfortable with the CSS `clamp()` function. Will ensure I do separate learning on clamp and attempt to use this in future, as other than font-size & padding adjustments the media queries were almost unnecessary.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: Overriding default button styles](https://css-tricks.com/overriding-default-button-styles/) & [MoOx's reset-button.css gist](https://gist.github.com/MoOx/9137295) were helpful when resetting browser styles for the HTML `<button>` element.
